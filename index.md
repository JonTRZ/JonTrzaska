## Career Objectives

Primarily interested in more corporate finance opportunities, my interests have more recently become intertwined with data science and business information systems. 
This summer I'll be working supply chain finance with Johnson & Johnson as part of their FLDP internship. Though I would like to return to the firm full-time, I am keeping my eyes open for more applicable roles that combine analytics and data science. I really am still deciding what exact role I want most after graduation, something that I hope to gain a better perspective on after this summer.

## Hobbies

Outside of my academic pursruits, I prioritize staying fit and healthy. I regularly work out and play on Lehigh's Ultimate Frisbee team, competing in up to 5 tournaments a semester. I am also a big movie fan, excited to see the future slate of Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The highlight of my Lehigh experience thus far has been being able to travel to Milan, IT for the summer in Professor Gupta's inaugural "Lehigh Business in Milan" program.
