## Career Objectives

Primarily interested in more corporate finance opportunities, my interests have more recently become intertwined with data science and business information systems. 
This summer I'll be working supply chain finance with Johnson & Johnson as part of their FLDP internship. Though I would like to return to the firm full-time, I am keeping my eyes open for more applicable roles that combine analytics and data science. I really am still deciding what exact role I want most after graduation, something that I hope to gain a better perspective on after this summer.

## Hobbies

Maybe include a little about these, especially if they are the kinds of things that work well in interviews.
